In Security the term "best practices" is often overused and actually none of them all are universally applicable or atleast not most effective in every possible scenario. Security best practices are presented as best solution for every problem but in reality what works in one environment might not be the best suitable for another. For example MFA is best practice at certain places but it can be an overkill in low risk enivronments. Sometimes best practices can be outdated due to changes in the attack methods  For instance In 2010 complex passwords might be enough but now without MFA, password manager or behaviour based authenticaion it will be less effective.

In Some cases best pratices create unnecessary hurdles for users and sometimes they aren't best because they trade off security for convience and cost-effectivness For Example overly complicated firewall rules and access controls can lead the users to find a workaround which creates more vulnerabilities. The more complex it gets the more probable for human error.

In my opinion, best practices should be clear, understandable, adaptable, regularly reviewed and implemented on specific risk assessments. We should focus on educating the Employee's over restricting them.

Security should enable bussiness, not paralyze it. Simplicity, clarity, and user empowerment are more efficient than confusing security architectures.
